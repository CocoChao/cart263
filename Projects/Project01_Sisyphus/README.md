  When I started this project, I understood that the idea behind a Sisyphus’ story is that no matter how hardworking the character is, he is always going to fail. Therefore, I went with a modern twist to fit our period of time, while still maintaining a link to Sisyphus’. I initiated my projects with the codes from my past assignments and in-class activities. I wanted to use pixels to draw most of my elements, however, it would take essentially more time for me to figure out how to do it.  My project’s concept goes like so: A lumberjack cuts a tree during a rainy day, but whenever the tree reaches the roots, it grows back up. When the mouse clicks on the tree trunk, the lumberjack stops moving as well. To empathize with the game character, I gave the player an option to drag the umbrella on top of the lumberjack, even if it does not necessarily block the rain. As a matter of fact, the umbrella could be dragged anywhere in the window, and it would not block any rain. It’s another aspect that makes the players fail their task, along with the lumberjack. As for the aesthetic choices, I went for a simple and straightforward 2D images. Since my GIF is the main element and is designed using vectors, I decided that the rest of my elements should also be flat images, but the rain shower is an exception. For the color scheme, I also followed the color palette of the lumberjack’s image to create a familiar environment and to assemble the game as one. Considering that Sisyphus is portrayed as muscular and strong on old Greek artefacts, I chose the GIF according to that criteria. Concerning the instructions, I used jQuery UI’s dialog interaction and I added an emoticon to make the player visualize the pain of being hit by rain without an umbrella on the lumberjack’s face. 

  Nonetheless, I faced a few challenges in the process. I wanted to implement a rain shower effect, to give a reason for the tree to continue growing. However, I had to search for reference codes online and modify small parts, so it correlates with my code. It was difficult to understand because most of the codes were not complete. Changing all the codes into jQuery was a complicated and time-consuming task, so I left it as it is. Also, due to the fact that I work with two separate windows on my screen all the time, all the elements are aligned on the left side of my screen. I did not work with the window at its full size, so the thought of placing the elements according to any window size did not come to my mind. 

Other improvements: 
-	Add a function that blocks the rain if the umbrella is placed on top of the lumberjack;
-	Add another event handler when the lumberjack reaches more than a certain score (for example: the rain could be pouring even more to reduce visibility after it reaches a score of 10 re-growth and add a thunderstorm element);
- Make the rain appear outside the window (on top of the lumberjack's image, behind the grey walls).
