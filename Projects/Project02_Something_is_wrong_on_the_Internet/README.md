  I implemented many aspects that are related to the concept and ideas from the article "Something is wrong on the Internet". The page begins with a WIFI logo searching for signals and responsiveVoice telling the instructions to the player. ResponsiveVoice imitates the voice of Mickey Mouse, the Disney character because of its high pitch and intonations, and it attracks a younger audience to continue looking around. In case the player did not understand carefully the instructions, they can open the instruction button, or say “say it again”, which will repeat the instructions in reverse. The code for the reversed instructions is from my previous assignment. Then, it changes into a loading screen once the player says: “Internet On”. The player sees the page loading and knowing that users tend to click anywhere on the screen when they’re impatient, I added a click function on the loading image to go on the next page. Annyang can only understand the “Play [insert video name]” and “Internet on/off” commands. The vocal commands create an illusion that the computer is automatic and follows your instructions. However, the player becomes confused when playing the incorrect mix matched puzzle game and the incorrect stories that comes with its cover. Considering that the puzzle will never be completed properly, the player will click on the “Next” button to read stories from the bookshelf. When the player is done interacting with the game, they say “Internet off”, which bring it to its setup screen with the WIFI Logo searching for signals. 

  During the process, I was inspired by some indie online games, but I modified the rules instead of following them. Instead of focusing on the aesthetic in style.css and the text in index.html like my past assignments and projects, my goal while building this program is to experiment with different jQuery Ui interactions and use responsiveVoice and Annyang to program the voice commands. To be able to get used to the different functions and effects from different libraries, and many ways to apply them in future projects. If I had the time, I would definitely fix the positions of all my elements in my game. Overall, I am satisfied of the amount of work I achieved. The objective of this game is to confuse, frustrate and disorient the player, so many buttons and shortcut are added to make the user give up.
