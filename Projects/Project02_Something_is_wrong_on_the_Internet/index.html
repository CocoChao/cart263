        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            There was once a Little Prince who lived by himself on a small asteriod called B-612. He believed
            that he should take care of his planet. So he always cleaned his three volcanoes and cut the baobab tree's
            roots that secretly grew underground and could split the planet into pieces. <br>
            One day, a seed mysteriously blossomed and turned into a flower. "You're so beautiful!" he said. "I'm going to
            water you and protect you with this glass globe at night!" The Little Prince decided to call her Rose. He
            loved her very mych and Rose loved her Little Prince. They were together all the time but because Rose was
            constantly demanding for the Little Prince's attention, he started to doubt about her feelings for him.
            The Little Prince decided it was time for him to make new friends. So he, went on a trip around the Universe
            leaving Rose behind. <br>
            On the first planet, the Little Prince found a King who had lived there on his own for many years. When he saw the
            Little Prince, he happily said, "Good, I've someone to rule now!" So, the Kind started to order him around and called
            him his subject. But the Little Prince was not used to taking orders from anyone! <em> Friends don't give orders anyways! </em>
            So, he decided to leave.
            <p>

        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Little Prince continued his journey and on the next planet, he found a man, very well-dressed. The vain man said to the Little Prince,
            "Oh, Now I have someone to admire me!" The man dessed in all sorts of clothes and expected the Little Prince always to tell hi how good he looked.
            But, after some times, Little PRince thought, "<em> Friendship should not be based only on compliments!</em>" So, he left.
            On the next planet, Little Prince found an old man with lots of books around him. "What are all those books about?" Little Prince asked.
            "I'm a geographer!" said the old man. "So, I write about the rivers, the moutains, and the deserts. Tell me about your planet so I can write about it!" <br>
            Little Prince started talking about himself, the volcanoes, the baobab trees and of course, about his Rose. "How wonderful!"
            said the Geographer. "But I can only write about the things that last forever. So, I cannot write about you and your Rose." The
            Little Prince had never thought that he or his Rose was not eternal and he felt sad. The Geographer had no interest in him and friends do. So, he
            left and traveled to a planet called Earth.
          </p>

        <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            On Earth, Little Prince met a Fox and asked her, "Can we be friends?" "Only if you tame me!" the Fox replied. The Little Prince was intriged.
            "What does taming mean?" he asked. "It means to establish ties, to create a bond," the Fox said. "Otherwise, you're just a little boy to me like
            thousands of other little boys and I have no need of you. And you too have no need of me for I'm just like any other Fox." "I'm beginning to understand,"
            said the Little Prince. "There is a flower. I think she has tamed me. I miss her a lot!" <br>
            So, the Little Prince realized that even though his flower was so proud and temperamental, she was unique to him and a true friend. “My Rose needs me!”
            he thought. So, he decided to go back. Back to his volcanoes and to his baobab trees.When the Little Prince saw her, he hugged his beautiful Rose and said,
            “I’m responsible and I will be with you forever!”

        <h3> Chapter 1 </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. All three pigs decided to build a house,
            and set off to the brickworks to buy some bricks. But soon the three little pigs came across a Man carrying a bundle of straw. The first little pig said to himself: "Now I won't need
            to walk so far to the brickworks! I'd much rather do less work, and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing." So the first little pig said to the Man carrying straw:
            "Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house." The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and
            prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon. Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3> Chapter 2 </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            To which the Pig answered, "No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin." "Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" said the Wolf. So he huffed and he puffed,
            and he blew his house in. Alas! because the house had not been very well made, it fell down, and the wolf was able to eat the little Pig up in an instant. Meanwhile the second
            and third Pig were still on their way to the brickworks. When they passed a Man with a bundle of sticks, the second little Pig said to himself: "Now I won’t need to walk so far
            to the brickworks! Sticks are stronger than straw – I think they'll do the job, but anyway, I'm tired now. I'd much rather do less work and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing."
            So the first little pig said to the Man carrying the sticks: "Please, Man, give me those sticks to build me a house." The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it
            right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon. Then along came the Wolf and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."
            "No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin." "Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!" So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he
            blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3> Chapter 3 </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Finally the third little Pig reached the brickworks, where he met a Man with a load of bricks. He said: "Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with." The Man kindly
            gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them a little way over, carefully, and taking the time to do it well. So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs,
            and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in." "No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin." "Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in." Well, he huffed and he
            puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the
            house down, he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips." "Where?" said the little Pig. "Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning,
            I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner." "Very well,” said the little Pig, “I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?" "Oh, at six o’clock."
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3> Chapter 4 </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six. When the Wolf came he said, 'Little Pig, are you ready?" "Ready!" said the little Pig, "I have been
            and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner." The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, "Little Pig,
            I know where there is a nice apple-tree." "Where?" said the Pig. "Down at Merry-garden," replied the Wolf; "and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o’clock to-morrow,
            and we will go together and get some apples."
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3> Chapter 5 </h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree,
            so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, "Little Pig, what! are you here before
            me? Are they nice apples?" "Yes, very," said the little Pig; "I will throw you down one." And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home.
            The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, "Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?" "Oh, yes," said the Pig, "I will go; what time shall you be ready?"
            "At three," said the Wolf. So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming.
            Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf
            so much that he ran home without going to the Fair. He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.
            Then the little Pig said, "Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill." Then the Wolf was very angry
            indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing
            fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper,
            and lived happy ever after.
